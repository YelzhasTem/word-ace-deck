# AI security

Memora treats every AI call as an authenticated, metered server operation. Browser UI state and CORS are not security boundaries.

## Endpoints

The production AI surface is limited to:

| Endpoint                     | Class | Units | Minute | Hour | Day | User concurrency | Gemini output tokens |
| ---------------------------- | ----- | ----: | -----: | ---: | --: | ---------------: | -------------------: |
| `getTranslations`            | light |     1 |     12 |   60 | 200 |                2 |                  384 |
| `generateAssociation`        | light |     2 |      8 |   40 | 120 |                2 |                  768 |
| `generateStudyText`          | light |     3 |      5 |   25 |  60 |                1 |                1,024 |
| `generateDeckWithAI`         | heavy |     5 |      3 |   12 |  30 |                1 |                4,096 |
| `importManualCardsFromText`  | heavy |     5 |      3 |   12 |  30 |                1 |                4,096 |
| `importManualCardsFromImage` | heavy |     8 |      2 |    8 |  15 |                1 |                4,096 |
| `generateDeckFromUrl`        | heavy |     8 |      2 |    8 |  15 |                1 |                4,096 |

`generateClozeSentence` was removed because it had no application caller. A new AI function must be added to this list, the server policy, tests, and CI in the same change.

## Authentication

Every AI `createServerFn` must use `requireSupabaseAuth`. The middleware accepts only an `Authorization: Bearer <user JWT>` header and verifies it with Supabase Auth. Missing, malformed, expired, invalid, and anon tokens return `401`. User identity is always taken from verified claims and never from request data.

The browser attaches the current access token through `attachSupabaseAuth`. On `401`, the AI client helper attempts one Supabase session refresh and retries with the same idempotency key. Authentication and metering remain entirely server-side.

## Quotas and budget

`acquire_ai_request` uses PostgreSQL transaction advisory locks to make idempotency, quota, global budget, and concurrency decisions atomically. `complete_ai_request` releases a slot in `finally`; active slots also expire after 90-300 seconds if a serverless invocation is interrupted.

The initial aggregate limits are 80 units per user/hour and 300 units per user/day. Global limits are 50,000 units/day and 25,000 heavy units/day. IP limits are deliberately softer than user limits: 60 requests/minute, 600/hour, 3,000/day, and 10 concurrent requests.

Runtime configuration is stored in `ai_runtime_config`; endpoint weights and limits are stored in `ai_endpoint_policies`. Both are server-only. Browser roles have no table privileges or RPC execution rights. The application server calls quota RPCs with the service role only after validating the user JWT.

To disable AI without a deployment:

```sql
UPDATE public.ai_runtime_config
SET enabled = FALSE, updated_at = clock_timestamp()
WHERE singleton;
```

Re-enable it only after the incident is understood. Individual endpoints can be disabled through `ai_endpoint_policies.enabled`.

## IP privacy

On Vercel, the server reads `x-vercel-forwarded-for`, falling back to Vercel's overwritten `x-forwarded-for`. It ignores client-provided forwarding headers outside Vercel. The address is HMAC-SHA-256 hashed with the server-only `AI_IP_HASH_SALT`; raw IP addresses are never stored or logged. Rotate the salt only when accepting that old and new IP buckets will no longer correlate.

## URL import and SSRF

URL import accepts only `http:` and `https:` without credentials or control characters. Local hostnames and metadata names are rejected. DNS must return only globally routable IPv4/IPv6 addresses; private, loopback, link-local, carrier NAT, multicast, unspecified, reserved, documentation, IPv4-mapped IPv6, and metadata ranges are blocked.

The validated address is pinned into the Undici connector, reducing DNS-rebinding exposure. Redirects are manual, limited to four, and each target repeats URL and DNS validation. No incoming authorization header, cookies, or secrets are forwarded.

Only HTML, XHTML, and plain text are accepted. The total deadline is 12 seconds. Responses are streamed, checked against `Content-Length` when present, and aborted above 512 KiB even when the header is missing or false. The server sends `Accept-Encoding: identity`; unsupported and binary formats are rejected.

## Input and provider limits

The server function body limit is 3.75 MB, below Vercel's platform limit. Text, arrays, URLs, card counts, and prompt characters have endpoint-specific Zod limits. Images are at most 2.5 MB decoded and must be PNG, JPEG, or WEBP with matching magic bytes and strict base64.

Gemini model selection is server-only through `GEMINI_MODEL`. Temperature, output tokens, retry count, system prompt, and response MIME are fixed in code. Provider calls have a 25-second timeout, at most one retry, and a 1 MB response-body cap. Client-supplied unknown model settings are stripped and ignored.

## Idempotency and errors

Every request carries a UUID idempotency key. The database binds it to the verified user, endpoint, and request hash. A concurrent duplicate or replay never invokes Gemini again. Reusing a key with different input is rejected.

Expected statuses are `400` malformed input, `401` authentication, `403` authorization, `409` duplicate/in-progress, `413` excessive payload, `422` unsafe or unsupported input, `429` quota, `502` provider failure, `503` kill switch/budget/security dependency, and `504` timeout. Responses never include provider bodies, stack traces, prompts, environment variables, keys, or internal URLs.

## Audit and monitoring

`ai_usage_events` stores only user ID, endpoint, timestamp, status, latency, request units, input/output byte counts, hashed IP, idempotency metadata, and a short error category. Rate-limit rejections are aggregated per minute in `ai_rate_limit_rollups`. Prompts, card text, images, AI responses, email, JWTs, API keys, and raw IPs must never be added.

Monitor daily units, heavy units, repeated `429` rollups, active slots near expiry, provider error categories, and per-user spikes. Keep detailed usage for no longer than 30 days unless a shorter operational requirement is sufficient; aggregate older data or delete it through a reviewed server-only maintenance job.

## Adding an endpoint

1. Add `requireSupabaseAuth`, strict input and output schemas, a required idempotency key, and `runAiEndpoint`.
2. Add a conservative request-unit weight, rate limits, concurrency TTL, prompt limit, output-token limit, timeout, and response-size limit.
3. Do not accept `user_id`, model settings, system prompts, retries, or provider limits from the browser.
4. Validate ownership before loading any deck, card, collection, or profile; service-role reads require an explicit ownership check.
5. Add auth, quota, parallelism, replay, payload, provider-mock, and output-validation tests.
6. Update this document and `.github/workflows/ai-security.yml` paths before deployment.
